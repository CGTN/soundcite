=========

**SoundCite is not ready for widespread use.**

SoundCite is a web-based tool that clips long audio files, such as songs or interviews, into short, embeddable clips that the user can embed into their text. We call this "inline audio," as the reader will see highlighted, actionable text to click on, which will result in the audio file playing inline. There is no standalone player. There are no controls beyond the simple click of the text. The underlying principle behind SoundCite is that the audio clip should not interrupt the reading experience; indeed, it should *augment* the reading experience.
