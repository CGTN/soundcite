##What Is SoundCite?

SoundCite is a web-based tool that clips long audio files, such as songs or interviews, into short, embeddable clips that the user can embed into their text. We call this "inline audio," as the reader will see highlighted, actionable text to click on, which will result in the audio file playing inline. There is no standalone player. There are no controls beyond the simple click of the text. The underlying principle behind SoundCite is that the audio clip should not interrupt the reading experience; indeed, it should *augment* the reading experience. 

SoundCite's power is in its simplicity. As a writer or editor looking to create a SoundCite object, you will go through these steps:

1. Login to SoundCite with your SoundCloud account. If you do not have a SoundCloud account, you can get a free account with 50 MB of storage on their website.
2. Use our uploader to select the complete audio file you want SoundCite to clip for you. This will upload the file to your SoundCloud account. 
	* If the file is already on SoundCloud, 	you should see a list of your SoundCloud 	uploads once you login. Choose the file 	from that list.
	* If you want to clip another user's file 	on SoundCloud, you can search SoundCloud's 	library from our website using the search 	bar provided.
3. Uploading the audio file will generate a waveform player that will allow you to play and pause, zoom in and out, and click and drag to find your clip's start and end points. You should also provide the text you want the audio linked to so that the generated embed code will be accurate.
4. Once you have the proper start and end points set, submit your selection, and SoundCloud will generate an embed code to paste into the post where the text you input earlier would normally go. This embed code will work in any CMS as long as you can view and edit the HTML of a post.
5. Preview or publish your post. You should see a SoundCloud object highlighting the text you input earlier.

##Why SoundCite?

Audio on the web today is detached from how far video, text, pictures, and animation have come in the past few years. Whereas videos can automatically generate captions, embed onto almost any web page, and play in any browser, audio, especially HTML5 audio, can hardly play in any format across web pages and browsers. Although audio naturally does not afford a visual interface, the web has always required one that removes audio from the rest of the web. It does not have to be that way. 

SoundCite brings the audio to your text.  Other attempts at the merging of audio and text have revolved around transcript production, such as Mozilla's Hyperaudio or *The New York Times*' 9/11 Tapes project, which puts the audio first and the text second. With SoundCite, we want to put the writer and the text first. Again, the audio is the augmenter. Your stories, interviews, reviews, and descriptions can be enhanced with the use of an inline audio clip, giving the reader a greater mental picture of your words.

In order to remain as subtle and non-intrusive as possible, SoundCite provides very little user interface, just enough to let the user know that clicking on the highlighted text will play a SoundCite clip. Some attempts at inline audio have also provided a standalone player so that the reader may listen to the sounds independently. We think that takes the clips out of context and puts the audio on a level above the text. By only providing subtle but consistent text highlighting, SoundCite embeds itself onto any web page easily and fluidly. Your article is still your article.

##How Does It Work?

SoundCite connects to your SoundCloud account, allowing us to use SoundCloud's superior, highly scalable hosting to serve your audio clips. Underneath both SoundCite and SoundCloud is SoundManager2, a JavaScript library that allows us to access each moment within an audio file, setting your start and end points with accuracy. Everything in SoundCite, from the uploader to player on your page, is done in HTML5 and JavaScript. No plugins, no Flash, nothing to install. SoundCite is deployable in every situation on the web.

##How Can You Use SoundCite?

SoundCite has three prominent use cases (though certainly, more will arise as our users think of them!):

1. Music. SoundCite can be a hugely useful tool for music journalists or music critics attempting to describe aural material through text. Certainly, these writers have made a living by evoking aural images in their readers through the written word, and with SoundCite, the writer can now provide an easily accessible link to what he or she is talking about. Rather than counting on the listener to find that moment of music themselves and then judge the statement, the discussion surrounding music can become more fluid and more intelligent.
2. Interviews. Sometimes, a journalist finds a source that has a particularly interesting voice, not only in perspective, but also in timbre. The print journalist has long sought ways to convey this source's voice, adding adverbs to their attribution when quoting the source. SoundCite erases the need for this fluffy language that can sometimes breach the line of editorialization. SoundCite *literally* puts the voice in the text.
3. Natural sound: One of the greatest aspects of broadcast journalism is its ability to use natural sound to set ambiance. Print journalism, in contrast, has been able to describe magnificent vistas and skylines through bold language and high-resolution photography. SoundCite adds a new sense to that writing: the aural sense.
