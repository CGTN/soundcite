        				Audio is a powerful device that can add emotion or context to a story. Unfortunately audio clips force uncomfortable choices: read or listen, but not both. Until now. SoundCite is a simple-to-use tool that lets you add inline audio to your story. The audio is not isolated; it plays right under the text <span class="soundcite soundcite-loaded soundcite-play" data-url="https://soundcite.knightlab.com/media/tame-impala_elephant.mp3" data-start="5992" data-end="6651">you choose</span>.

        				<li>Keep it brief! Long clips distract from the story.</li>
        				<li>Select your link text carefully. Try not to use so much text that it wraps to two lines.</li>
                <li>Remember you don't have to cut up your audio file. Soundcite can serve multiple segments from a single source.</li>
